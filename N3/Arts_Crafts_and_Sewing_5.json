If you knit and love to accumulate guides, stitch dictionaries, pattern books and design-your-own project books, this is a great resource. I find I'm always adapting knitting patterns slightly or significantly to swap out cables, add interesting borders so I can knit edges and body at the same time, what have you.\n\nThis gives you enough classic stitches to satisfy but its strength is in fresh twists on the usual or entirely new (at least to me) options in textured, lace, cables&cross stitches, slip st., and novelties. As others note, the stitches are arranged from simplest to most challenging in each section-- also a great help when deciding how much sweat and tears I'm wiling to expend.\n\nThis also does not frustrate me in the ways too many other books and guides do.\nHere, Leapman uses the symbols common in knitting magazines and most books on knitting you've seen. Yay!\nOne of my peeves with some designers and guidebooks is the use of their own symbology for charting various stitches. Alice Starmore leaps to mind as a woman living in her own private Idaho filled with her own Runic symbols. I have to translate her every chart's cable squiggles into the symbols I'm more familiar with just to get the thing going. Gorgeous end results, but geez.\n\nThis is concise but full of options, so I FIND something nifty quickly and easily.\nWhile I do love browsing Barbara Walker's stitch books, sometimes I'm just looking for a simple option and don't want to spend all day combing through umpteen volumes, each of which has its own section for lace, k/p, cables, slip st.s, panels, etc. I wish Walker would compile all her lace, all cables, all k/p, all color work, all panels, etc into huge sections in just ONE encyclopedia.\n\nUntil that happens, this is my new go-to for fast, interesting ideas to enhance my knitting.\n\nThis is not a great resource for traditional knitting stitch patterns, such as gansey (guernsey), it's perhaps best for 'modern' classic knitting.", "summary": "My current favorite go-to guide for inspiration", "unixReviewTime": 1439337600}

Yes, there are old favorites here, but the depth of new stitch techniques and ideas of how to work them into patterns has really helped to round out my large, huge, library of stitch encyclopedias. While some lace is covered, it is not a huge book of lace designs. The world has many. They are needed, but I don't make much lace. If you want reverse stockinette, cables, texture and strong fabrication, this is a great book.\n\nAll patterns are charted, as well as written and the colors tabbing the section make sense. There is little on, \"how to do basic stitches,\" taking up page space. While that information is important, I find the redundancy of the simple knit and purl to be a tree-wasting effort to round out some books, which would be better off without them. If you cannot knit, nor purl, perhaps this is not the book to start with. Which is fine! It's part of the journey of knitting. There is no end to this road of interest and there should not be, Texture, working patterns into garments and general beauty with color photographs, that are not over-the-top, but show the finished pattern in good light, are the hallmarks of this book.\n\nIf you knit can you exist without it? Well, of course. If you want to get a book with stitches I've not found elsewhere, then this is a must own. So much so, that after buying the edition for my Kindle, I got the book. I can't leave an entire sticky notepad's worth of paper in my Kindle. I can in the book and that's what I've done to this book. It sits in my pile in my studio space, within reach at all times. Right next to my Barbara Walker books and Vogue stitch dictionaries. I use it daily and make up swatches often, just to get a feel for them and to learn. Anyone who wants more will find this book a great resource. This is all my own thoughts. I am not being solicited in any way and  believe me, I can slam with the best of them.\n\nEnjoy and get out the highlighter and notes.

Donnelly", "reviewText": "Here's the review I also have posted on my blog, Polymer Clay Review [...]\n\nYes, another 5-star book. Are there books I don't like as much? Yes. Have those been published lately? No.\n\nIt has been a decade-yes, a decade-since Donna published her first book, The Art of Polymer Clay. This second book takes us to Donna today. Her style is elegant, her techniques are innovative, and her instruction makes her projects accessible. I've taken two classes from Donna. In fact, I joined my local clay guild when I first started claying just to take Donna's class-and I haven't looked back.\n\nDonna's book is like a portable Kato class. Donna taught many of these techniques in the classes I took from her. However, having this indispensable reference book enables me to review the class at my leisure and further experiment with her techniques. She approaches each technique in a straightforward manner-teach techniques, then apply them to a project. This enables us not only to complete a sample that masters the technique, but also a very beautiful finished piece that will get people talking.\n\nDonna splits the book into seven different sections:\n\n  * Polymer Clay Basics\n  * Mica Shift Techniques\n  * Transferring Images Onto Polymer Clay\n  * Creating Texture\n  * Paints, Inks and Pigment Powders\n  * Special Effects with Liquid Polymer Clays\n  * Sculpture and Mold Making\n\nI love Donna's techniques. They are the result of hours of experimentation and development on her part. The book details both how to do something-and why. For instance, Donna makes a mold from her rubber stamps using polymer clay and THEN uses that mold to create her pieces. She goes into detail about why she does this, and what the results are molding directly from a stamp versus taking an impression from a polymer clay mold made from a rubber stamp. It's something I never considered, but it makes great sense.\n\nThe twelve beautiful projects are accompanied by step-by-step instructions and photographs that walk you through each major component. While some projects are simple, others teach you techniques in constructing complex pieces like her coveted Japanese Inro boxes.\n\nPeppered throughout the book are awe-inspiring inspirational pieces, including the pieces submitted for two of Kato Polyclay's artists contests/exhibitions-one focused on shoes (Feat of Clay) and one focused on boxes. I was honored to be the 2nd-place winner in the box contest, and my \"Donnelly's Sampler\" is included in the book.\n\nThis is yet another book that will stay in my permanent library. I love having a Donna class on my shelf, ready for me at any time.", "summary": "Donna Kato Class At Your Fingertips", "unixReviewTime": 1186099200}

Just got my copy today and it exceeded all my expectations by a long shot!  I seriously was only interested in the milk can block after I saw a quilt made from the pattern online but I had no idea all the blocks in this book were designed for both 6\" and 12\" blocks so if you didn't want to make a whole quilt, you could take any of the 6\" blocks and use them to make potholders which is just about the only thing I really have time to make right now.  I also loved the mason jar block which I've seen in one of her stand alone quilt patterns so it was a bonus to get this in the book as I didn't already have it.  Lori did a fabulous job pairing the fabric colors to each block theme and tying together all the block themes into farm related  motifs.  She has managed to design quilt blocks that I would think would normally be approached through paper piecing with simple squares and rectangles to get the most charming shapes like cherries, barns, little chicks, etc.  If you are a Lori Holt fabric collector you will get a big kick out of seeing many of the prints from her fabric designs in the blocks as well which really inspired me to want to pull out some of my fabrics to get started on my favorite blocks.  Although there are no sewing, knitting or other needle art themed blocks in the book which would really be a nice addition to the farm house/home made lifestyle theme of the book, there are plenty of prints with sewing motifs in them which made it extra special to me.  I noticed Lori used her classic color palette that she used in her last book Quilty Fun, but has added more grays and newsprint fabrics which I thought was awesome, giving the look a bit of a contemporary feel to it.  The other plus I found that I loved in the book is that most of the squares are based on 1/4\" and 1/2\" increments, only a few required cutting squares in 1/8\" increments which are more challenging for me to get accurate cuts (I rely on Accu Cut and Sizzix quilt dies quite a bit for my cutting which are all based on the 1/4 and 1/2\" increments).  I seriously cannot believe the huge amount of work that went into the making of this book.  It was well worth the price, there is just so much in there, it is jam packed with not only the blocks but many quilt patterns as well.  Well done Lori, so proud of you!  I know the Fat Quarter Shop sponsored a sew along online using this book so you can do an image search on Google to get a really good sense for what people have done with the patterns.  The theme of this book is so timely as more and more people are re-embracing home gardens, farm fresh produce, and our connection to the farmers that grow our food and yet the theme is also very authentic for Lori as she was raised on a farm as her parents and grandparents were so there are some very precious vintage black and white photos in the book that are just adorable.  I never knew that about Lori, it was fun to read a bit about her childhood growing up on a farm!  For some reason this book makes me want to go out and buy some seeds to start growing a little kitchen herb garden that I have been wanting to do for a good long time now!", "summary": "Outstanding Quilt Book", "unixReviewTime": 1447286400}

Many times when looking through a craft book written by one person, when all the ideas are theirs, there tends to be a sameness about the projects, but not this book. More than just the author's ideas, there are purses made by many contributors which helps give an even larger variety of ideas than one person can accomplish on their own. There are also many different needlecraft types used for the different purses, so whatever your favorite type of needlecraft, you can find a purse to make. There are purses made in leather, cloth appliqus, crocheted, needlepoint, etc. The bags come in every size too, from larger tote style bags to tiny purses that you can use for a necklace. Lots of full color photographs of the projects also.\n\nThe only really bad thing I observed in this book is no actual patterns which for some of us that are drawing impaired could be a problem. But all in all a good book that should inspire you as you craft your next purse.\n\nI was surprised to see the many negative reviews here on this book. I will admit that I wouldn't want to make some of the bags in this purse, but then I have seen advertisements for purses that cost over $13,000 that I wouldn't use if you paid me.

All of the patterns are inspired by natural forms found in nature The author, Norah Gaughan, in the introduction, states that she has \"always been torn between simultaneous desires to study art and science\". This book is a good example of how she combines the two and creates beauty. As Norah's life progressed, she realized that what she truly loved was knitting and wanted to make a career as a knitting designer. \"The work in this book feels like the melding of my science - and art-loving selves...\". \"Some of the designs in this book are structurally similar to nature's example.\" This can be seen by the chapter headings themselves. \"In some cases, the structure of the natural phenomenon dictated the structure of the garment (the garments made from hexagonal and pentagonal pieces, for instance). In others, the pattern from nature become a surface decoration imposed on the grid of knitting...\". \"In all cases, working within the framework of six categories of patterns found in nature freed my mind to look at things differently and allowed me to rethink the structure of garment-making.\"\n\nMany of the patterns are eye-catching and lovely. In Hexagons, the Asymmetrical Cardigan in a lovely light blue hue is definitely a pattern I want to try. It is knit in cashmere . The stitch in this cardigan is modeled after the woven pattern of caned chair seats. The Hex Afghan is stunning. Knit in a rich brownish-red, half alpaca and half wool, it contains rows of elongated hexagons.\n\nThe Swirled Pentagon Pullover is luscious. Knit in an angora and wool blend, it is an almost turquoise colorway. The top of the pullover has swirled pentagons and the bottom of the sweater is knit in a classic stockinette stitch. The Bubble Pullover is knit in a lovely violet color out of baby alpaca. It has large pentagons as its motif.\n\nThe Spiral Scarf is very 'now'. Its contemporary feel is obvious to the knitter. It is knit with Mongolian Cashmere in a golden and blue hue and is comprised of spirals attached together. The Cabled Spiral Pullover is knit in a light blue colorway from extra fine merino DK. There is a spiral motif on the top and the bottom two thirds of the sweater is knit in stockinette stitch.\n\nThe Roundabout Leaf Tank is knit in an ivory hue with silk yarn. \"The seater is made out of a spiraling strip, in the same way that leaves grow on a stem.\" The Phyllotaxis Scarf is perfect for a man or woman. Knit in a brown colorway with a wool, mohair and silk combination yarn, it is reversible. The scarf is knit in a tube to make its reversibility possible. \"There are five spirals slanting to the right and eight spirals slanting to the left so the pair from the Fibonacci sequence is 5-8.\" I love the Sunflower Tam. There are two examples in the photograph. One is green and the other yellow. They are knit with Icelandic wool. \"For this tam, I wanted to make a disk with two opposing spirals, like the phyllotaxis of a sunflower, daisy, or coneflower.\"\n\nThe Fractal section has several nice patterns. I really like the Branching Aran Guernsey knit with wool. \"I purposefully incorporated some traditional elements of the British guernsey into this design - the drop-shoulder shaping and the simple ladder pattern between the columns of the cables - and like the way they play against the naturalistic, very modern, branching cables.\" The Serpentin Coat, knit in browns and blues with merino wool, is perfect for an autumn day. \"The sinuous motif used on the yoke of this coat is a Dragon Curve, another mathematical fractal.\" The Triangle Scarf is in a dark beige and knit with a combination of nylon and rayon yarn. It features triangles based on a mathematical fractal called the Serpinski Triangle.\n\nThe Wave section of the book has several lovely patterns. I really like the Vortex Street Pullover in a green/brown blend knit with cotton. \"A phenomenon of fluid dynamics, a vortex street is an organized pattern of spirals formed in the wake of fluid flowing past a solid object.\" The center of this pullover has a wave section with stockinette surrounding it. The Reflection Aran Pullover is knit in a deep wine color out of wool. \"Inspired by the rule of wave reflection, the cables in this pullover 'reflect' off of the edges of the center panel.\" The Droplet Hat is another Aran pattern knit in a green colorway with wool yarn. \"This design is based upon a photo showing a droplet of water speeding downward propelled by gravity, spewing off little droplets as well as a narrow trail of water. My interpretation is rendered in bobbles and embossed leaves.\"\n\nOverall, this book is a real winner with clear photographs of the projects and easy-to-read pattern instructions. Some of the photos are a bit sexist for my taste but I can overlook that. They just seem silly. The book itself is a very welcome addition to my knitting library.", "summary": "Knitting and Nature Meld", "unixReviewTime": 1330646400}

First, she dresses up the conventional 6-pointed star with 7 patterns that incorporate borders, stacked strippy units, and even applique (making for a very Dresden-like star).  Next, triangles morph into flowers with 2 unique designs.  Cline ends with two Pinwheel-based projects: one is embellished with buttons and the other has a vivid tessellating appearance.  Each project includes a short \"Life Lessons\" box illustrating the huge influence on the author of her Mennonite family.  Photographs are in abundance, and highlight the exceptionally nice quilting details.  Both traditional and contemporary quilters will find something very pleasing here.\n\nAs for skill level, my opinion is that this book might be a challenge for some new beginners, as there are templates (included) and Y-seams;  precision piecing skills will be a must.  But I still recommend this book for all skill levels, as I remember when I first started out I went straight to the tough stuff so I could learn everything all at once.  (In retrospect, perhaps that approach is not recommended!)  Additionally, an endless supply of fabrics - or friends with fabrics - would be helpful because each quilt allows wonderful opportunities to play with value and contrast.\n\nThis book is set apart from all the rest, and not just for its beautiful contents.  Budget-conscious quilters might like to know there could be an extra ruler, an additional tool, and new products in their future:\n\n1. Ruler -  Creative Grids 60-degree Triangle&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Creative-Grids-60-Degree-Triangle-Finished-Size-Up-to-8-Quilting-Ruler/dp/B0017RGKCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Creative Grids 60 Degree Triangle (Finished Size Up to 8\") Quilting Ruler</a>.  I was hoping I could use the Clear-View Triangle I already own, but no.  The CG triangle is longer (and thus wider at the base) than the CV one, and most importantly the CG also has a differently configured tip.\n2. Tool - Ms. Cline recommends using&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Jinny-Beyer-Perfect-Piecer-Quilt-Template/dp/B0050W9FRW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Jinny Beyer Perfect Piecer Quilt Template</a>&nbsp;for help with Y-seams\n3. Materials - 108-inch wide black nylon netting (used as an overlay to create an amazing receding effect in several projects), batiste (for triangle foundations), 20-inch wide double-sided fusible web (Ms. Cline uses Shades SoftFuse which will add significant cost to your projects:  each 8x9 inch segment is about 1.00 per piece)\n\nMs. Cline is also the author of another absolutely stunning book&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Star-Struck-Quilts-Dazzling-Diamonds-Tradiational-Blocks-13-Skill-Building-Projects/dp/157120959X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Star Struck Quilts: Dazzling Diamonds & Tradiational Blocks; 13 Skill-Building Projects</a>.
